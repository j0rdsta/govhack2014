### About the Frameworks

###### Laravel
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

###### Foundation
Foundation is an advanced front-end framework with support for making web applications responsive and simplifying design creation. Bundled with Libsass using Bower and NPM, foundation is very powerful.

### Laravel Documentation

Documentation for the entire laravel framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

### Foundation Documentation

Documentation for the entire foundation framework can be found on the [Zurb website](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs).
